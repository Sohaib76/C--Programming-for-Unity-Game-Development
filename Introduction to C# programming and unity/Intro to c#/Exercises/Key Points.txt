if a class is static   >>>>  when calling the method of that class we have to use that class name.
EXAMPLE:  Math.sqr()


if class is not static >>> when calling the method, we have to specify the object name.


Deck deck  = new Deck(); 

{Deck is class name , deck is object,  new Deck() is contructor to create the class }

*, When we call contructor or method we put ()
When call property no ().
